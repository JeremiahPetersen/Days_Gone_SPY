# Days_Gone_SPY
Market Data Analysis for the S&amp;P 500 

This was my first JavaScript project where I gathered historical market data, and used the data to make future predictions for SPY<br>
<br>
Mock site - Imagine.html<br>
<br>
Run index.js for daily data and predictions.<br>
<br>
Market Data (spyFULLALL.js) last updated on 05-01-23<br>
<br>
Working towards 100% automation<br>
<br>
Data Gathering, Algo results, and other Data are in the "Algo Data Excel Sheets" Folder

# TODO

- [ ] convert SpyFULLALL.js to json or other format
- [ ] Automate data collection
- [ ] Automate daily predictions
- [ ] Automate data results
- [ ] Refactor JavaScript components
